# orglog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edunham/orglog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edunham/orglog)

The Rust and Servo projects enjoy giving credit to those who contribute to
their GitHub repos, and congratulating new contributors when they land their
first commits. 

The [gitstat](https://github.com/youknowone/gitstat) tool turns `git log`
output into pretty graphs and statistics about new contributors and
contribution types. 

`orglog` is designed to concatenate the git logs of all source repositories
(not forks) in a given organization.

## Usage

Copy `credentials.py.example` to `credentials.py`, and edit it to contain the
GitHub username and password of an account without 2-factor auth. 

Alternately, set the `GH_USER` and `GH_PASS` environment variables to contain
the username and password of a GitHub account without 2-factor auth. 

Then run `python orglog.py orgname` and the log will be created. 

## Gitstat

The following goes into gitstat's `local_settings.py`:

```
TEMPLATE_FILE = 'aggregate_template.html'
INPUT_FILE = 'log.txt' # None for stdin
OUTPUT_FILE = 'index.html' # None for stdout
```

## Contributing

Look for `#TODO` in orglog.py. Pull requests welcome.
